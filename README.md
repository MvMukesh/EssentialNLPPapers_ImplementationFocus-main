### `1. Foundational Papers (Year: 1990s - 2000s):`

* (1997) [Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)](https://bioinf.jku.at/publications/older/2604.pdf) :bulb:
  - This paper introduces LSTMs, a crucial building block for modern NLP models. Understanding LSTMs is essential for many later papers.
* (2000) [Maximum Entropy Markov Models for Information Extraction and Segmentation (MEMMs)](https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~strctlrn/bib/PDF/memm-icml2000.pdf) :bulb:
  - This paper introduces MEMMs, a common machine learning technique used in traditional NLP tasks like information extraction.
* (2000) [A Statistical Part-of-Speech Tagger](https://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0003055.pdf)
  - This paper demonstrates a powerful HMM-based POS tagger, introducing many core concepts,tips and tricks for building such classical systems.
* (2003) [A Neural Probabilistic Language Model](http://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume3/bengio03a/bengio03a.pdf) :bulb:
  - This paper is a foundational work in deep learning for NLP, introducing an early effective neural network-based language model.
* (2003) [Feature-rich part-of-speech tagging with a cyclic dependency network](https://nlp.stanford.edu/pubs/tagging.pdf)
  - This paper proposes powerful linguistic features for building a high-performing POS-tagging system some number of powerful linguistic features for building a (then) SOTA POS-tagging system.
* (2004) [ROUGE: A Package for Automatic Evaluation of Summaries](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/W04-1013) :vhs:
  - This paper introduces ROUGE, a widely used evaluation metric for summarization tasks(ROUGE is used to this day on a variety of sequence transduction tasks).
* (2010) [From Frequency to Meaning: Vector Space Models of Semantics](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1003.1141.pdf)
  - This paper provides a great survey of existing vector space models for learning word meaning from text. A wonderful survey of existing vector space models for learning semantics in text. 
* (2012) [An Introduction to Conditional Random Fields (CRFs)](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/csutton/publications/crftut-fnt.pdf)
  - This paper offers an in-depth overview of CRFs, a common sequence labeling model used in NLP tasks like POS tagging and named entity recognition.
